# Google-Search-Page-Mock-Up
Hi, This is the first Github ready project I've created using HTML and CSS! Essentially it is a Google Search Page Mock-Up using some personalized design elements. Enjoy :) 

Using HTML, I created code to mimic the appearance of the page as well as the appearance of the functionality buttons, icons, as well as Google profile picture in the top right hand corner. 
This project is my first Github ready project and I am very pleased with the outcome of this project! I learned a lot more about HTML and CSS by actively creating within vscode, this pushed my knowledge beyond what I had previously known, and picked up some neat tips and tricks regarding html & css along the way. 

I was able to maintain a neat and organized coding work space on both the index.html as well as the style.css file. Both can be accessed and the code can be viewed. 

The goal for this project was to be able to develop my html and css skills more, and also to increase my skills when it came to web design - which I am happy to say that both goals were met! I can confidently say, I have a grasp on html/css and will be developing my skills further. Either to increase how in-depth this project can be (as stated before, the clickable links are merely for show and don't navigate further - so maybe I can revisit this and make those links navigate the user to a different page), or create a new html/css project with an entirely new project goal in mind. 

As there isn't much to navigate through, please take into account, that this is essentially a building block for my journey as a developer. I plan to create more projects with problem-solving capabilites. 

Please take the time to take in the project, as well as the code! Other than that, I hope you have a great rest of your day, thanks :)
